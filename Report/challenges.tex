\section{Challenges Faced During Analysis}
\vspace{-0.1in}

We faced the following challenges while trying to achieve best possible accuracy for the given classification problem:

\begin{itemize}
\item Availability of less data for running SVM model which is considered as a strong classification technique
\item Finding best possible estimation for missing data values is crucial to this problem as significant amount of data is missing in some of variables.
\item Selecting parameter in SVMs was one of the most time consuming things as the parameters don't have any fixed values and varies from model to model.
\item Variables such as Cabin had lot of missing values, the presence of which could have been crucial as people who stayed in lower decks are said to have died in this tragedy.
\end{itemize}
