With the advent of large number of social media platforms in the past decade, the data availability has increased exponentially. In tandem to this is the increase in the viewership of movies and the revenue generated by the film industry. Keeping in mind the fact that film industry contributes a lot to the economy of a country, there is a need for some quantitative approach to reduce the risk affiliated to any movie based on its success or failure. In this project we try to find such quantitative answers and predictions about the revenue of a movie.
We show that a simple model built from the rate at which tweets are created about particular topics can outperform market-based predictors. We further demonstrate how sentiments extracted from Twitter can be further utilized to improve the forecasting power of social media.
